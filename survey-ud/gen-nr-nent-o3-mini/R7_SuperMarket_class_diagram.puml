' The Payment use case UC6 (Process Payment) internally performs total calculation (UC7)
' and then generates an invoice (UC8). Payment can be made either by cash (UC9)
' or by cheque (UC10), with cheque payments applicable to extra-customers (e.g., organizations).
' Similarly, product ordering involves preparation (UC11), packaging (UC12) and delivery (UC13)
' after which customers receive their order (UC14).
