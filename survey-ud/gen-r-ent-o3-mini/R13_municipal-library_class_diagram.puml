' Relationships:

' Library aggregates many Documents and Books
Library "1" o-- "many" Document : includes
Library "1" o-- "many" Book : includes

' A Member borrows Books. 
' The association indicates that a member can borrow 0..3 books.
Member "1" -- "0..3" Book : borrows
Book "0..1" -- "1" Member : borrowedBy

' Note the constraint on the borrowing process
note right of Member : A member can borrow a maximum\nof 3 books.
