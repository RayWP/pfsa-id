  "document_class": "The Right-Way Rental Truck Company rents small moving trucks and trailers for local and one-way usage  Each rental office rents vehicles that they have in stock to customers ready to take possession of the vehicle  We don’t take reservations, or speculate on when the customer will return rented vehicles  The central office oversees the vehicle distribution, and directs transfers of vehicles from one rental office to another  We log the current mileage just before we rent a truck, and then again when it is returned  For each individual customer, we record the customer’s name, home phone, address, and driver’s license state, number, and expiration date  If a customer damaged a vehicle, abandoned it, or didn’t fully pay the bill, then we tag the customer as a poor risk, and won’t rent to that customer again  Yes, we do have customers rent two or more vehicles at the same time"
