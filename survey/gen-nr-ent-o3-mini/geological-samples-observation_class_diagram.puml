' Associations

' A Sample is obtained as a Specimen from the field
Sample --> Specimen : "originates from"

' A specimen (or its parent sample) is collected from a Location.
Sample --> Location : "collected from"

' A sample may be split into derived samples (sub-samples) 
Sample "1" <-- "0..*" Sample : "derived"

' A sample can be processed in one or more labs.
Sample "0..*" -- "0..*" Lab : "processed in"

' Each Lab runs its own LIMS System.
Lab --> System : "runs"

' Each Lab produces one or more Observations.
Lab "1" --> "0..*" Observations : "produces"

' Observations are made on a (parent or derived) Sample.
Observations --> Sample : "observes"

' Optional: a Samples collection aggregates multiple Sample objects.
