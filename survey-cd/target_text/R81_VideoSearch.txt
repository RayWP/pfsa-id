System Features 
Torrent Search Description and Priority 
The user will give a search term that will search through a database of compatible torrent websites added by the development team. The results of this search will be displayed as web links in a tab on the program's main window. This is one of the software's main features and therefore has a high priority for development. 
Stimulus/Response Sequences 
User ticks the torrent tick box – the system will now query the torrent websites in its database when a search is started. 
The user enters the search term and starts the search – system sends queries to the torrent websites in its database based on the search term. Results for this query will then be sent to the torrent tab in the program, where they will display information such as website, seeds, peers, size, date posted, and a link for the webpage. 
The user sorts the search results by clicking once on a column header – the system sorts all results in descending/ascending order. 
The user clicks on the next page button – the system displays the next set of results for the search.
